绝望的主妇

THE LAST FANTASY

My name is Mary Alice Young. When you read this morning's paper, you may come across an article about the unusual day I had last week.

我叫玛丽·艾莉丝·杨 如果你看了今天的早报 可能会读到一篇报道 有关我上周异常的一天

Normally, there's never anything newsworthy about my life, but that all changed last thursday.

通常 我的生活没有任何新闻价值 然而 直到上周四 一切都改变了

Of course, everything seemed quite normal at first.

起初每件事情都显得很平常

I made breakfast for my family.

我为家人准备早餐

I performed my chores.

做家务

I completed my projects.

完成手工制作

I ran my errands.

取回干洗的衣服

In truth, I spent the day as I spent every other day, quietly polishing the routine of my life until it gleamed with perfection.

事实上 这天太平常不过了 平静地打理着家里的一切 直至完美

That's why it was so astonishing when I decided to go to my hallway closet and retrieve a revolver that had never been used.

这就是为什么 当我走向走廊的壁橱 拿出从没用过的左轮手枪时 会如此令人震惊了

My body was discovered by my neighbor, Mrs. Martha Huber, who'd been startled by a strange popping sound.

第一个发现我尸体的是 我的邻居玛莎·胡博太太 她被这突如其来的声音吓了一跳

Her curiosity aroused, Mrs. Huber tried to think of a reason for dropping in on me unannounced.

受好奇心驱使 她想到一个 不请自来的理由

After some initial hesitation, she decided to return the blender she had borrowed from me six months before.

片刻犹豫之后 她决定把半年前 借去的搅拌机还给我

It's my neighbor. I think she's been shot. There's blood everywhere. Yes, you've got to send an ambulance. You've got to send one right now.

我的邻居 她被枪击了 地上全是血 是的 快派救护车过来 赶快

And, for a moment, Mrs. Huber stood motionless in her kitchen, grief-stricken by this senseless tragedy.

然后 有那么一会 胡博太太静静地站在厨房里 陷入了深深的悲伤

But only for a moment. If there was one thing Mrs. Huber was known for, it was her ability to look on the bright side.

但 仅数秒而已 如果说胡博太太有什么优点 那就是凡事她都往积极的一面去想

I was laid to rest on a Monday.

我的葬礼在星期一

After the funeral, all the residents of Wisteria Lane came to pay their respects.

葬礼结束后 紫藤郡的邻居们 都去我家表达他们的哀思

And, as people do in these situations, they brought food.

他们按照惯例 带来了食物

Lynette Scavo brought fried chicken.

勒奈特·斯加沃带了炸鸡

Lynette had a great family recipe for fried chicken.

勒奈特家有很棒的炸鸡秘方

Of course, she didn't cook much while moving up the corporate ladder. She didn't have the time.

当然 当她还在职场打拼的时候 她很少做饭 因为没时间

But when her doctor announced she was pregnant, her husband Tom had an idea.

但当被告知怀孕后 她的老公汤姆有了主意

"Why not quit your job?" "Kids do better with stay-at-home moms." "It would be so much less stressful."

"你不如辞职吧" "全职妈妈有利于孩子的成长" "这样压力也会小很多"

But this was not the case. In fact, Lynette's life had become so hectic she was now forced to get her chicken from the fast-food restaurant.

现实却不尽如人意 勒奈特的日子变得更加忙碌 以至于她不得不去快餐店 点了份外卖炸鸡

Lynette would've appreciated the irony if she'd thought about it. But she couldn't. She didn't have the time.

如果勒奈特回头想想 她会发现一切都背道而驰 可惜 她根本没时间

Stop it, stop it, stop it. - But, mom.

都给我停下来 -但是 妈妈

No. You are going to behave today. I am not going to be humiliated in front of the entire neighborhood. And, just so you know how seerious I am...

别这样 你们今天得乖乖的 我不想在整条街的邻居 面前丢脸 你们要知道 我不是说说而已

What's that? Santa's cell-phone number. How did you get that?

那是什么 圣诞老人的手机号码 你怎么得到的

I know someone who knows someone who knows an elf. And if any of you acts up, so help me, I will call Santa and I will tell him you want socks for Christmas. Are you willing to risk that? Ok. Let's get this over with.

我朋友的朋友认识一个小精灵 如果今天你们谁捣蛋 相信我 我会打电话给圣诞老人 告诉他 圣诞节你们只想要袜子 想试试吗 好 那就乖乖的吧

Gabrielle Solis who lives down the block brought a spicy paella.

住在街角的加布丽尔·索利斯 带了西班牙辣味炒饭

Since her modeling days in New York, Gabrielle had developed a taste for rich food... ...and rich men.

自从在纽约做了模特后 她的品位有了很大的提升 只吃名贵食物 只约有钱男人

Carlos, who worked in mergers and acquisitions, proposed on their third date.

卡洛斯 从事兼并与收购业务 在第三次约会时向她求婚了

Gabrielle was touched when tears welled up in his eyes.

加布丽尔被他的泪水打动了

But she soon discovered this happened every time Carlos closed a big deal.

但她很快发现 卡洛斯每做成一笔大生意时都会这样

Gabrielle liked her paella piping hot. However, her relationship with her husband was considerably cooler.

加布丽尔喜欢热腾腾的炒饭 然而 她和丈夫的关系 却日益冷淡

If you talk to Al Mason at this thing, I want you to casually mention how much I paid for your necklace. Why not pin the receipt to my chest? He let me know how much he paid for his wife's convertible. Look, just work it into the conversation.

你跟艾尔·梅森聊天时 不妨顺便透露下 你项链的价钱 干脆在我胸前贴上标签好了 他故意告诉我 他为他老婆的 敞篷车花了多少钱 不经意提到就好

There's no way I can just work that in, Carlos. Why not? At the Donahue party, everyone was talking mutual funds. You found a way to mentioned you slept with half the Yankee outfield.

卡洛斯 我做不到很随意地插话 怎么会呢 在唐纳修的宴会上 每个人都在谈论公共基金 而你却想方设法告诉大家你跟扬基队 一半的外场手上过床

I'm telling you, it came up in the context of the conversation. Hey, people are starting to stare. Can you keep your voice down, please?

我再说一次 当时大家就是谈的这些 人们在看我们了 你能小点声吗

Absolutely. We wouldn't want them to think we're not happy.

当然了 我们可不愿意 被别人发现我们不愉快

Bree Van De Kamp, who lives next door, brought baskets of muffins she baked from scratch.

住在隔壁的布里·范德坎普 带了两篮她亲手烤制的松饼

Bree was known for her cooking, and for making her own clothes, and for doing her own gardening, and for re-upholstering her own furniture. Yes, Bree's many talents were known throughout the neighborhood.

布里擅长烹饪 自己缝纫做衣 亲手打理花园 甚至自己翻新家具 是的 布里非常能干 远近皆知

Everyone on Wisteria Lane thought of Bree as the perfect wife and mother. Everyone, that is, except her own family.

紫藤郡的每个人都觉得 布里是个完美的妻子 每个人 不包括她的家人

Paul. Zachary.

保罗 扎克

Hello, Mrs. Van De Kamp.

你好 范德坎普太太

Bree, you shouldn't have gone to all this trouble.

布里 不必这么麻烦的

It was no trouble at all.

Now, the basket with the red ribbon is filled with desserts for your guests, but the one with the blue ribbon is just for you and Zachary.

It's got rolls, muffins, breakfast type things.

里面有面包圈 松饼 和一些早餐食物

Thank you.

Well, the least I could do is make sure you boys had a decent meal to look forward to in the morning. I know you're out of your minds with grief.

Yes, we are.

Of course, I will need the baskets back once you're done.

对了 吃完后请把篮子还给我

Of course.

当然

Susan Mayer, who lives across the street, brought macaroni and cheese.

住在对街的苏珊·梅尔 带了乳酪通心粉

Her husband, Karl, always teased her about her macaroni, saying it was the only thing she knew how to cook and she rarely made it well.

她丈夫卡尔 总是嘲笑她 说她只会做乳酪通心粉 却还做不好

It was too salty the night she and Karl moved into their house. It was too watery the night she found lipstick on Karl's shirt.

在她和卡尔刚搬入新家的那晚 她做的太咸了 在她发现卡尔的衣领上有口红印那晚 她做的又太淡了

She burned it the night Karl told her he was leaving her for his secretary.

在卡尔为了他的秘书离开她的那晚 她把通心粉烤糊了

A year had passed since the divorce. Susan had started to think how nice it would be to have a man in her life. Even one who would make fun of her cooking.

离婚一年之后 苏珊开始觉得 生命中有个男人还是挺好的 就算是个会嘲笑她厨艺的男人

Mom, why would someone kill themselves?

妈妈 为什么人们会自杀

Well, sometimes people are so unhappy, they think that's the only way to solve their problems.

因为有时候人们很不开心 觉得自杀是解决问题的唯一办法

Mrs. Young always seemed happy. - Yeah.

杨太太看起来总是很开心啊 -没错

Sometimes people pretend to be one way, when they're totally different on the inside.

有时候人们表现出一面 而内心却是截然不同的一面

Oh, you mean like how dad's girlfriend always smiling and says nice things, but we know she's a bitch.

就像爸爸的女朋友满脸微笑 讲话动听 但我们都知道她是个贱女人

I don't like that word, Julie. But, yeah, that's a great example.

朱莉 我不喜欢你用那个词 不过 这个例子很棒

You're welcome.

感谢你们的到来

What's going on?

怎么样了

Sorry I'm late.

对不起我来晚了

Hi, Susan. - Hey. So, what did Karl say when you confronted him?

嗨 苏珊 -嗨 当你跟卡尔对质的时候他怎么说

You'll love this. He said... "It doesn't mean anything. It was just sex."

说得可好了 他说 "这根本不能说明什么 仅仅是性而已"

Ah, yes, page one of the philanderer's handbook.

哦 是啊 花花公子手册第一页

Yeah, and then he got this zen look on his face, and he said, "you know, Susan, most men live lives of quiet desperation."

是啊 然后他就一脸无辜地对我说 "你知道 苏珊 大多数男人都生活在平静的绝望之中"

Please tell me you punched him.

告诉我你揍他了

No. I said, "Really? And what do most women lead lives of noisy fulfillment?"

没有 我说 "真的吗 那么大多数女人 吵吵闹闹的一生又算什么"

Hmm. Good for you.

说得好

I mean, of all people, did he have to bang his secretary? I had that woman over for brunch.

我是说 那么多人 你就非要搞上自己的秘书吗 我还给那女人做过早午餐

It's like my grandmother always said -- an erect penis doesn't have a conscience.

正如我祖母常说的那样 男人那儿硬的时候没有良知可言

Even the limp ones aren't that ethical.

即使不硬也是没什么良知

This is half the reason I joined the NRA. Well, when Rex started going to those medical conferences, I wanted it in the back of his mind that he had a loving wife at home with a loaded Smith & Wesson.

这也是我加入枪支协会的原因之一 当雷克斯开始参加那些医学会议时 我希望他明白 家里有个很爱他的妻子 和一把上了膛的沃森左轮手枪

Lynnie, Tom's always away on business. Do you ever worry he might?

So, Susan, is he gonna stop seeing that woman?

所以 苏珊 他还会再见那个女人吗

I don't know.

我也不知道

I'm sorry, you guys, I just... I just don't know how I'm gonna survive this.

抱歉 姐妹们 我只是 我不知道自己要怎么熬过去

Listen to me.

听我说

We all have moments of desperation. If we can face them head-on, that's when we'd find out how strong we really are.

我们都有绝望的时候 当我们熬过去的时候 就会发现自己有多强大

Susan. Susan. I was just saying Paul wants us to go over on friday. He needs us to go to Mary Alice's closet and help pack up her things. He says he can't face doing it by himself.

苏珊 苏珊 我说保罗请我们周五过来 帮他整理玛丽·艾莉丝的衣橱 收拾下她的遗物 他说他不能独自面对

Sure. That's fine. - Are you ok?

好啊 没问题 -你还好吧

Yeah. I'm just so angry. If Mary Alice was having problems, she should have come to us. She should've let us help her.

没事 我就是太生气了 如果玛丽·艾莉丝当时有问题 她应该告诉我们 让我们帮她

What problems could she have had? She was healthy, had a great home, a nice family. Her life was... Our life.

她能有什么问题 她很健康 舒适的房子 和睦的家庭 她的人生就是 我们的翻版

No. If Mary Alice was having a crisis, we'd have known. She lives 50 feet away, for god sakes.

不会的 如果当时玛丽·艾莉丝有危机 我们会发现的 她住的那么近

Gabby, the woman killed herself.

加布 那个女人都已经自杀了

Something must've been going on.

I wouldn't eat that if I were you. - Why? I made it. Trust me. Hey, hey, do you have a death wish?

如果我是你 我绝不吃那东西 -为什么 那是我做的 相信我 等等 你有什么遗愿吗
